"""
Python module for MS and Tandem MS. Made for the Computational Biology course
at University of Antwerp. Only works in Python 3, but has support for PyPy.
There are no dependencies.

Author: Evert Heylen

Commandline usage:

   - for MS1: ``python -m ms.MS1 <MS1 sample>``
    
   - for Tandem MS: ``python -m ms.MS2 <MS2 sample>``
   
   - to run the tests: ``python -m ms.tests [--all]`` (the ``--all`` flag also includes some very resource-hungry tests)
